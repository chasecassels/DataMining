A collection of files for dynamical system analysis. 
-3D_dyn_model can be used as a template for numerical integration and analysis of 3D systems. Current values model the Lorenz system with the standard parameters
-disc_map_bif can be used as a template for bifuration diagrams for discrete maps. Current values give a bifurcation diagram resembling a symmetric logistic map
